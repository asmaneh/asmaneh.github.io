## Asmaneh’ Platforms and Its History

The first activity under the name of Asmaneh in social networks was in 2007 as a google group limited to the students and professors of the master’s program of “Iranian Architectural Studies” in Shahid Beheshti University, which later extended to include their counterparts in Art University of Isfahan. In 2016, the group was replaced by a Telegram group with the same name, Asmaneh.

## Asmaneh Telegram Channel

Asmaneh Telegram Channel was created in May 2016 by **Samaneh Mohseni Hosseinabadi** and **Zahra Golshan** under the supervision of **Mehrdad Qayyoomi Bidhendi**. The channel gradually developed through the efforts of its editorial board members– especially **Saba Madani** and **Dena Shamsizadeh**– and the cooperation of **Motahareh Danaeifar**, **Mohammad Fallah**, and **Sina Soltani**, along with other content producers. Asmaneh channel was administered by **Reyhaneh Heydari** from 2016 to 2019 and is currently managed by the editorial board of Asmaneh network. This channel is still the main section of Asmaneh network.

## The Previous Website of Asmaneh

The website of Asmaneh was created on 14 June 2016 – thanks to the efforts of **Motahareh Danaeifar**, **Yahya Sepehri**, and the late **Bita Qahramani**, under the supervision of Mehrdad Qayyoomi – as a collection of blogs written by enthusiasts of history and theory of architecture and art (and was titled “Asmaneh Circle”). **Media Tools Company** was in charge of its web design and programming, and **Babak Vandad** was responsible for its maintenance from 2018 to 2021. Asmaneh Circle introduced itself as:

>“Asmaneh Circle” is a collection of blogs written by those who hold an opinion about history and theory of architecture and art, and would like to be a part of this circle, regardless of their connection to specific organizations or universities, of their age, of their reputation or popularity. Thus the open circle of Asmaneh is where one can meet new experts in the field, see the youth and the elderly side by side, be informed about their works and ideas, encourage new and old thinkers to write, and expand engagement in dialogue. Therefore, this is the only part of the forthcoming Asmaneh Network, which is intentionally based on individuals. Yet, it is not to marginalize anyone for not having official titles or reputation […]. The advantage of several blogs being put together is that the audience would benefit from a set of ideas and findings by different people in a more or less common field. The blog collection, to which we refer as Asmaneh Circle, is not an official organ representing an association or a movement but is rather as a party hosting various guests who have at least one thing in common: attending the party; and they all tend to act in a way that the party goes on. It appears that the audience of this circle benefits a lot more from the whole set of writings than from single ones. Furthermore, they can start a discussion by expressing ideas about essays or taking part in one.

Asmaneh Circle was administered by **Yahya Sepehri**, **Motahareh Danaeifar**, **Saba Madani**, **Dena Shamsizadeh**, and **Mojtaba Mehrali** in the last four years. The website of Asmaneh Circle was replaced by the new one, Asmaneh, on 24 September 2021.
