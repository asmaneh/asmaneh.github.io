<p dir="ltr"><strong>Modern Men and Amateurs of Antiquitities: Collecting Practice in 19th Ottoman Tunisia</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">In the 19th century, ancient Carthage served as a major point of competition between European archaeologists, which led to both French and British governments pursuing a newly revived rivalry fifty years following the Campaign of Egypt. This practice awakened a new taste for antiquities amongst the local ruling class, who became increasingly aware of the significance and prestige of their ancient cultural heritage. Ministers and the Bey himself constituted rich collections, the most famous of which belonged to the main Tunisian families of the 19th century. The result of ongoing sustained effort, these collections had a notoriety exceeding the country, guaranteeing the fame of their owners on a transnational level, as when they were exhibited in World&rsquo;s Fair of 1855 and 1873. The Tunisian ruling class quickly became aware of the stakes of their cultural heritage, formerly ignored, which became an important referent of national identity before the French colonization in 1881.&nbsp;</p>
