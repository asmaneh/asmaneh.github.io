<p>▪️Workshop on the Role of Eighteenth-Century Indo-Persianate Albums</p>
<p>The workshop will address the role of Indo-Persianate albums (muraqqaʿs) that were assembled for or collected by the Mughal governors of Awadh (Uttar Pradesh), Shujaʿ al-Daula (reigned 1754&ndash;1775) and his successor, Asaf al-Daula (reigned 1775-1797), as well as other local elites in Bengal and Bihar. Europeans also participated in the creation and consumption of albums, as patrons and collectors. In 1882, the Prussian State acquired a group of twenty albums from the twelfth Duke of Hamilton; so far, these artworks have received little study.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eight of them belonged to the Scottish surgeon and interpreter Archibald Swinton (1731&ndash;1804) and ten to the Franco-Swiss engineer and architect Antoine Louis Henri Polier (1741&ndash;1795) &ndash; both were British East India Company officers deeply acquainted with Indo-Persian aristocratic culture. Many more albums are linked to well-known European figures, such as the Governor-General of Bengal Warren Hastings (1732&ndash;1818) and the French Company officer (and special agent to Shujaʿ al-Daula in Faizabad) Jean-Baptiste-Joseph Gentil (1726&ndash;1799). Numerous interrelated questions arise from the study of this material, concerning audiences, artists, patrons, collectors and their wish to produce and preserve knowledge; these questions are to be discussed in this workshop.</p>
