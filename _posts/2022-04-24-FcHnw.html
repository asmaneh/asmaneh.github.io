excerpt: "This special issue of IJIA focuses on the impact of the current climate crisis on the built environments of the Islamic world, a space encompassing the Middle East, as well as Africa, Asia, and more recent geographies in Islam’s global dimensions. Specifically, it seeks to unpack this complex topic by utilizing architecture as a space of discourse for thinking about how one might craft a theory of ‘critical environmentalism’ across the Islamic world."

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">This special issue of IJIA focuses on the impact of the current climate crisis on the built environments of the Islamic world, a space encompassing the Middle East, as well as Africa, Asia, and more recent geographies in Islam&rsquo;s global dimensions. Specifically, it seeks to unpack this complex topic by utilizing architecture as a space of discourse for thinking about how one might craft a theory of &lsquo;critical environmentalism&rsquo; across the Islamic world. To this end, IJIA encourages contributions that offer different or nonconventional interpretations of environmentalism as well as how communities individually encounter and define environmental concerns and incorporate natural design elements into structural responses and solutions specific to the context. Further, papers might address how architecture as an analytical mechanism challenges established approaches and tendencies that position the built environment in opposition to environmentalist concerns. This special issue also aims to be strongly interdisciplinary, drawing from fields ranging from urban design, history, architecture, archaeology, sociology, and anthropology, towards accommodating a diversity of discourses that focus on regions, communities, and built environments not widely addressed in scholarship on Islamic space. Contributors should fully exploit the self-reflexive potential of this remit towards addressing a spectrum of critical approaches to the built environment in the Islamic world that not only position architecture as a theatre of environmental performance, but also a platform from which to consider additional conditions revolving around issues of race, gender, ethnicity, culture, and politics as they relate to environmental challenges and concerns. Such case studies are particularly important toward generating a comparative interrogative approach to effectively consider the ongoing encounter/relationship between humanity and the natural world over time and space.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Examples of themes contributors might wish to explore include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
<p dir="ltr">- Imagining sustainable futures/architecture as an environmentalist frontier</p>
<p dir="ltr">- Global warming, climate change, and its social/cultural impacts</p>
<p dir="ltr">- Natural aesthetics as design inspiration</p>
<p dir="ltr">- Green architecture in desert environments</p>
<p dir="ltr">- Environmentalism, heritage, and its discontents</p>
<p dir="ltr">- Eco-Islam and the &lsquo;Green Deen&rsquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr">- Armed conflict and its environmental impacts/implications</p>
<p dir="ltr">- Petropolitics and sustainable space</p>
<p dir="ltr">- Architecture and ecological conservation/preservation</p>
<p dir="ltr">- Non-traditional/emerging designs, materials, and spaces</p>
<p dir="ltr">- Colonial/postcolonial frameworks in environmental discourse</p>
<p dir="ltr">- AT (appropriate technology)</p>
