<p dir="ltr">▪️Umm as-Surab (north-eastern Jordan): Settlement Dynamics in the Islamic periods. New data from Building Archaeology</p>
<p dir="ltr">The site of Umm as-Surab is located in the extreme north of Jordan and is part of an articulated and homogeneous system of rural settlements that are distributed over a large basaltic area that also includes an important part of the south of present-day Syria. The Hellenistic-Roman and Byzantine periods are archaeologically well represented thanks to the presence of temples, churches and monasteries as well as a well-studied corpus of Greek and Latin inscriptions and a good knowledge of pottery. In recent years, new research perspectives have also been opened for the periods following the Islamic conquest, thanks to an ever-increasing interest and attention to the material culture of rural contexts for these periods.</p>
