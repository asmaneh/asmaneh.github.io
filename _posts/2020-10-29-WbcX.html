<p><strong>فراخوان مشارکت در پروژۀ &laquo;۱۰۰ داستانِ ۱۰۰ جهان نهفته در یک شیء&raquo;</strong></p>

<p>▪️100 Histories of 100 Worlds in 1 Obje<em>ct</em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>How many stories can a museum object have? Our departure point is the 2010 BBC Radio 4 programme (and subsequent book) A History of the World in 100 Objects narrated by then British Museum Director Neil MacGregor. Providing a colossal platform for the British Museum, the project reinstated the idea of the museum as a &lsquo;view from nowhere&rsquo; and everywhere at the same time. It was presented as a place to see the world; yet without any reflection on how the institution itself obtained and reframed the objects in order to create its own seemingly universal narrative.</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>We are seeking writers, researchers, curators, artists, and activists who will pick one object from the British Museum podcast and present ideas on how their narrative could be expanded through new stories and formats (e.g. Cartoons, Photo essays, Poetry, or alternative museum labels) for a new multi-language and multi-format publication project. Our priority is contributors who identify as of colour. We welcome marginalized voices, minoritized writers, and in particular contributors from communities of origin or association of these objects. We would encourage contributors who do not have community connections to the object to seek co-authors who do. Contributors who do not have community connections to the object can be considered in collaborative projects, i.e. with leading co-authors who do. To ensure accessibility we plan to publish contributions through a range of different media, including website, podcasts, and a book. We encourage authors to draw on methods and literature beyond the &lsquo;Western canon&rsquo; and English, with an output being a refreshed bibliography (possibly with translated texts) for &lsquo;object biographies&rsquo; with a more inclusive range of philosophies that might inject much needed critique into a discourse dominated by Western-style s</em>cholarship.&nbsp;</p>
