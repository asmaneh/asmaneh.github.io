<p dir="ltr">▪️Oral History and Architectural History: Theory, Politics, Method</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Architectural historians have responded to the political and social demands of our time by seeking to remedy the underrepresentation of marginalized voices in our work. Growing conversations concerning diversity and representation (sparked by the #MeToo movement, Black Lives Matter, and the Architecture Lobby, among others) compel architectural history&mdash;a facet of architectural education and practice&mdash;to ask the same questions of itself. In this context, it is crucial that historians not just chronicle the overlooked makers or users of the built environment but also understand how different people experience spaces and gain meaning from them. Yet this task presents particular challenges: many such voices are elusive in the archive, with their presence (or absence) tied to social power and existing disparities of wealth, race, gender, and ability. Moreover, users&rsquo; experiences are often simply more fleeting than visual material or project records.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">This roundtable considers one compelling method for addressing this need: oral history and other interview-based approaches. Oral history uniquely can bring subjectivities of the user into analysis of designed forms, incorporating the perspectives and experiences of those traditionally absent, if not excluded, from historical accounts. This method shifts architectural history away from a preoccupation with style, aesthetics, and elite value systems, towards an anthropology and sociology paradigm. Such expansion of research sources not only adds layers of interpretation and meaning that visual or formal analysis cannot accomplish alone, but also democratizes and humanizes architectural history.&nbsp;</p>
