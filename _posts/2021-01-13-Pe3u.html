<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">Oral Tradition Volume 34, comprises four essays that demonstrate, in the diversity of their topics and approaches, the broad reach of the study of orality and oral tradition. This volume brings together traditions from three continents&mdash;as well as, perhaps unexpectedly, the work of one of the twentieth century&rsquo;s most famous novelists.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">These essays appear at the conclusion of a difficult year. Throughout this period of global crisis, scholars have been, for the most part, in the very fortunate position of being able to continue their scholarly work, even if many have had to contend with closed libraries, quarantine restrictions, and other challenges.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">New technologies&mdash;above all platforms for video conferencing&mdash;have made it possible for them to collaborate with colleagues, engage with students, and enjoy the support of friends and family even as they endure physical isolation.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">The mediated socialization that characterizes our current moment stands in contrast with the direct, embodied interactions normally presupposed by oral tradition. The essays presented here, and in previous volumes of Oral Tradition, thus stand as a reminder of what we miss for the time being, and what we can look forward to regaining.</p>
