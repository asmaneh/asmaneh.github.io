<p dir="ltr">▪️Architectural History +&nbsp; Climate Emergency</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Symposium places the nexus between architecture and energy centre stage in our understanding of the historic built environment, considering how both large-scale energy consumption and socio-political regimes of energy production force us to give greater consideration to architecture&rsquo;s environmental impact through time.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">By investigating the relationship between buildings and energy, in conjunction with other factors such as the building industry's contribution to deforestation, eco-system destruction, and wide-spread pollution connected to primary material procurement, architectural history can reclaim its long-standing place as a central contributor to architectural debate and practice. Much more importantly, considering the history of architecture in this context can make a significant contribution to understanding and addressing the fossil fuel dependency and biodiversity crisis that threatens the continuation of life on Earth.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Held virtually, we&rsquo;ve expanded the Symposium to a month&rsquo;s programming on the most pressing issue of our time. Join us for 3 Keynote Lectures by leaders in their fields, a specially convened workshop by our supporters and partners aimed at boosting climate literacy among the discipline, and three afternoons of short papers highlighting new areas of architectural historical enquiry, demonstrating innovative methodological approaches to histories of the built environment.&nbsp;</p>
