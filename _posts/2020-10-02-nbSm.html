<p dir="ltr">▪️Online Exhibition: In the School of Wisdom: Persian Bookbinding ca. 1575-1890</p>
<p dir="ltr">Curated by: Matthew Elliott Gillman -- Ph.D. candidate, Department of Art History &amp; Archaeology, Columbia University</p>

<p dir="ltr">This digital exhibition reprises a physical one held in Columbia&rsquo;s Rare Book and Manuscript Library between October 2018 and March 2019. Its restaging might pose an irony, given that the show&rsquo;s concept and title, drawn from a lyric poem, concerns ephemerality. Translating this experience to the web nevertheless offers an opportunity to underscore its very theme.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">While viewers might be seduced by many examples, &ldquo;In the School of Wisdom&rdquo; is not an exhibition of beautiful bindings. Rather, it presents a suggestive history, one wherein the art of bookbinding cannot be disentangled from a manuscript's fragility. As will become apparent from the entries, nearly every cover shown here is a replacement, not an original. This fact of remaking is fundamental to manuscript history, whether in contexts of production or reception.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">the following "pages" are neither an exact re-presentation of the exhibition which appeared in the Chang Octagon nor, strictly speaking, its catalog. Instead, the format invites viewers to trace their own connections and discover, hopefully, the importance of a closed book.<br /><br /></p>
