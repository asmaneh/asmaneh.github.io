<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;National Parks in Prospect</p>
<p dir="ltr">For a proposed peer-reviewed special issue of Art Journal, we seek submissions of original essays, interviews, artworks, and creative reflections that analyze the role of art and visual culture in relation to National Parks in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Although we are concerned with increasing Art History&rsquo;s engagement with the National Parks, we welcome interdisciplinary approaches as well as writings from scholars in academia, the NPS, and other affiliations. This set of essays will explore the National Parks in prospect, in all its multivalent meanings; that is, as sites of natural and cultural extraction, as landscapes that bring into view (and occlude), and in terms of their future potential. We especially welcome submissions that address the following prompts:</p>
<p dir="ltr">- How does the visual culture of the National Parks continue to intervene in the politics of land through contributions to evolving discourses of the environmental movement and imperatives of Indigenous sovereignty?</p>
<p dir="ltr">- In addition to contributions that address the NPS&rsquo;s foundational dispossession of Native American territories, following Martin Berger, how do they participate in the depiction of nature as spaces of whiteness?</p>
<p dir="ltr">- What role does the NPS play in urban placemaking, which has transformed entire downtowns like that of Lowell, Massachusetts, into cultural museums?</p>
<p dir="ltr">- How does the visual culture of National Parks intervene in debates about the proper preservation and care of historical sites and monuments in the NPS&rsquo;s purview?</p>
<p dir="ltr">- How does the NPS engage in the history of art through their stewardship of the homes and studios of artists like Emery and Ellsworth Kolb, Augustus Saint-Gaudens, and J. Alden Weir, and artist in residence programs such as Art on the Borderland at Big Bend National Park?&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">- Whose interests and which audiences are represented by the National Parks&rsquo; visual culture?</p>
<p dir="ltr">- How does the art and visual culture of US National Parks function in transnational contexts, including cross-border parks with Canada and Mexico, or compare with other park systems globally?</p>
<p dir="ltr">- Contributions by or that consider contemporary artists who integrate the visual culture of the National Parks into their work, or site-specific installations by contemporary artists like Ai Wei Wei at Alcatraz Island.</p>
