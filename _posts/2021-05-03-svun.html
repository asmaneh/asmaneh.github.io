<p dir="ltr">▪️Introduction to Arabo-Islamic Manuscript Culture: An Intensive Course</p>
<p dir="ltr">At the heart of this introductory course are manuscripts and the knowledge they contain. The course consists of six open lectures and three closed practical sessions, taking students on an exploration of Islamic intellectual heritage from its origins to the modern era.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The lectures begin by tracing fundamental perspectives of heritage, along with related terms, concepts and disciplines dealing with manuscripts. After a survey of writing materials and formats, we will focus on the Arabo-Islamic manuscript tradition, outlining its textual and physical aspects. We will also discuss the cultural history of the Qur&rsquo;an and Hadith documentation and authorship, as well as issues in the history of reading, learning and the transmission of knowledge, the role of libraries, the book trade, and the preparation of editions.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">In this course, we follow the dynamic life cycle of the manuscript and the text, starting from the origin of the work (authorship) and its manifestations and textual relations, through the production of the manuscript(s), until the reception of both in the past and present, considering the social and cultural contexts.</p>
<p dir="ltr">By the end of the course, you will have the basic knowledge and context to better understand the intellectual and social contexts of Arabo-Islamic books and deal with manuscripts in Arabic language and script.</p>
