<p dir="ltr">▪️CALL FOR SUBMISSIONS: GETTY RESEARCH JOURNAL</p>
<p dir="ltr">We are pleased to invite submissions to the Getty Research Journal, no. 15 (February 2022). Now published twice a year, in February and in August, the journal features the work of art and architectural historians, museum curators, conservators, and other experts around the world as part of the Getty&rsquo;s mission to promote the presentation, conservation, and interpretation of the world&rsquo;s artistic legacy. Articles are peer reviewed. The journal considers submissions of original scholarship on all cultures, regions, and time periods, and welcomes articles relevant to the Getty&rsquo;s initiatives, research projects and themes, and collections. We seek to include a diversity of methodological approaches; topics and cultural perspectives that remain marginalized in art history and related fields; work by scholars of underrepresented backgrounds and/or in early career stages; and articles that expand narratives on global culture.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Getty Research Journal publishes full-length articles (5,000&ndash;10,000 words, including endnotes, and 8&ndash;12 illustrations) and shorter notices often highlighting new research, acquisitions, or discoveries in the Getty&rsquo;s collections (1,500&ndash;5,000 words, including endnotes, and 3&ndash;7 illustrations). The Getty Research Journal is distributed in print and electronically by the University of Chicago Press, Journals Division, and is also archived on JSTOR.</p>
<p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Submissions are reviewed on a rolling basis. Submissions received by January 1, 2021, will be considered for the spring 2022 issue. Authors submitting in languages other than English should submit as early as possible to allow for additional time needed for peer review and translation. The journal will translate articles accepted in languages other than English.</p>
