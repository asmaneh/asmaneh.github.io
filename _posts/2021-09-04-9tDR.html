<p>فراخوان مقاله برای نشریهٔ &laquo;بیست و یک: جستار&zwnj;هایی در هنر و تاریخ و فرهنگ بصری&raquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>▪️Call for Articles|21: Inquiries into Art, History, and the Visual &ndash; Beitr&auml;ge zur Kunstgeschichte und visuellen Kultur</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are pleased to invite submissions to the journal 21: Inquiries into Art, Theory, and the Visual. Published quarterly, the journal presents peer-reviewed articles on the visual arts of all cultures, regions, and time periods. The journal welcomes a diversity of perspectives and methodological approaches, and seeks to include work that expands narratives on global culture. This forum embraces the full range of diverse objects, questions, and methodologies that comprise and enrich the discipline. In parallel with this openness in subject matter, 21: Inquiries is available online as an Open-Access-eJournal, making it freely accessible to the widest possible audience. We do not charge "Author processing charges" (APCs) and are a scholar-led journal. Authors retain the copyright and full publishing rights without restrictions. Our issues are published with the license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0, unless this license has to be removed for a specific issue because of restrictions by the provider of the image rights. The journal 21: Inquiries into Art, History, and the Visual &ndash; Beitr&auml;ge zur Kunstgeschichte und visuellen Kultur was launched in September 2019 with the aim of establishing a new forum for art history. We particularly encourage topics and cultural perspectives that remain marginalized in art history and related fields, and work by scholars of underrepresented backgrounds and/or in early career stages.</p>
<p>The choice of the title indicates the intent of the editors to expand the boundaries of traditional art history by integrating all methodologies and subject matter related to images and visual phenomena around the globe. The journal seeks to publish methodologically and theoretically rigorous contributions that can claim a relevance for their topic beyond exemplary single-case studies. The multilingual aspect of art history and visual studies is reflected in the multiple languages in which the journal is published: contributions are welcome in English, German, French, and Italian, but we would also be interested in bilingual edited issues in further languages. In our reviews section, we strongly encourage reviews of exhibitions and books in languages that differ from the original.</p>
